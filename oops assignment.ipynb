    "Q1 what is the object oriented programing(OOP)?\n",
    "-> IT is programing style where software is designed using object using object\n",
    " bundle of data and behavior that represent real world things\n",
    "\n",
    "Q2 what is a class in oop?\n",
    "-> class is blue print or templet for creating object\n",
    "\n",
    "Q3 what is object in oops \n",
    "-> an object is a instance of class if class is a blueprint then an objecet is the actual \n",
    "   thing created from the bluprint\n",
    "\n",
    "Q4 what is difference between abstraction and encapsulation\n",
    "->  abstraction mean showing only the essintial detail and hiding unnecessary comlexity\n",
    "    help to reduce comlexit by hiding internal worklig\n",
    "    encapsulation -means bundlig data and method together and restricting access to some parts\n",
    "    focus on how data id protected\n",
    "\n",
    "Q5 what are the dunder methos in python\n",
    "-> dunder method are special build in meethod in python whose names start with two underscore \n",
    "   like __init they are also called as magic \\ special method\n",
    "\n",
    "Q6 expain the concept of inheritance in oops\n",
    " -> inheritance is an object oriented programing feature that allows one class to take on \n",
    "    the properties and behabior of another class\n",
    "   -it lets you create new classes based on existing ones reusing code and reducing repitation\n",
    "   \n",
    "Q7 what is polymorphism in oop \n",
    " -> the same method name can behave differntly depending on which object is usind it\n",
    "    you can write general code that works for many different object types make program more flexible \n",
    "    extandable and cleaner it have two types 1-method overriding 2-method overloading\n",
    "\n",
    "Q8 how encapsulation achived in python \n",
    " -> encapsulation is the oop concept of restricting direct access to an object data\n",
    "   python does not enforce strict access control like some language but provide conventions and mechanism\n",
    "   -protected attribute - prefix with sinle underscore _sum\n",
    "   -private attribute - pefix with double underscore __sum\n",
    "   -public attribute have no underscore\n",
    "\n",
    "Q9 what is constructor in python\n",
    "-> a constructor is a special method that used to intalize a new object of a class it called automatically \n",
    "  when you create an instance of a class the constuctor in python is always named\n",
    "\n",
    "Q10 what are class and static method in python\n",
    "-> class method -that works with the class itself rather than instance of the class\n",
    "   - it takes cls as first parameter define using @classmethod\n",
    "   static method - behaves like regular function but lives inside a class for organization\n",
    "    it does not take self or cls define using @staticmethod\n",
    "\n",
    "Q11 what is method overloading in pythod\n",
    "  -> method overloding is the ability to define multiple method with the same but different\n",
    "    parameter in the same class\n",
    "\n",
    "Q12 what is method overloading in oop\n",
    " -> it is happen when child class provides its own version of a method that is alreasy defines in its parent class\n",
    "    the method name and parameter must be the same\n",
    "\n",
    "Q13 what is property decorator in python \n",
    " -> property decorator in python is used to turn a method into a read only attribute\n",
    "    you can access methodd like attribute without using parenthesses()\n",
    "    make code cleaner \n",
    "\n",
    "Q14 why polymorphism is important in oop\n",
    " -> it is ability of object of different classes to be treated as object of a common superclass\n",
    "    -make code flexible and reisable\n",
    "    -reduces conditiona logic\n",
    "    - support clean and maintainable design\n",
    "\n",
    "Q15 what is an abstract class in python\n",
    " -> it is a class that cannot be instantiated on its own it is meant to serve as a blueprint for other classes\n",
    "    can define method that must be implemented by any subclass ensuring a consisent interface\n",
    "\n",
    "Q16 wht are the advantage of oop\n",
    "-> 1-code organnization\n",
    "   2- reusability\n",
    "   3-encapsulation\\ data hiding\n",
    "   4-maintainability\n",
    "   \n",
    "Q17 what is the difference between a class variable and instance in python\n",
    " -> class variable- variable that is shared among all instances of the class\n",
    "    defined directly inside the class outside the class outside any method\n",
    "    instance variable -that is unique to each istance of a class \n",
    "    it is defined inside the __init__method \n",
    "\n",
    "Q18 what is multiple inheritance in python\n",
    " -> it is occur when a class inherit from more than one parent class this allows the child class to \n",
    "    reuse attributes and methods from multiple classes\n",
    "\n",
    "Q19 the purpose of __str__ and __repr__method in python \n",
    "-> __str__method provde a human readable string repressentatiion of an object\n",
    "     used when you print an object or use str(object)\n",
    "     -__repr__provide an official representation of the object \n",
    "     used when you type the object in the interactive shell or call repr(object)\n",
    "\n",
    "Q20 what are the significance of the super function in python\n",
    " -> -avoid explicit parent class name\n",
    "    - support multiple inheritance\n",
    "    - reuses parent functionality\n",
    "\n",
    "Q21 what is the significance of the __del__method in python\n",
    " -> -resource cleanup \n",
    "    - custom action on deletion\n",
    "\n",
    "Q22 what is difference between @staticmethod and @classmethod in python\n",
    " - @staticmethod does not receive any implicit first argument\n",
    "   it behaves like a regular functiion but lives in the class namespace\n",
    "-  @classmethod it is receives the class (cls) as the first argument instead of the instance\n",
    "  it can access of modify class level attribute used as alternative constuctor\n",
    "\n",
    "Q23 how does polymorphism work in python with inheritance\n",
    "-> with inheritance polymorhphism usullay appears in method overriding a subclass can provide its own \n",
    "  version of a method defined in its parent class\n",
    "  - each object responds according to its own class implentation\n",
    "  - python determine at runtime which method to call this is called dynamic polymorphism\n",
    "\n",
    "Q24 what is method chaining in python oop \n",
    " -> it is a technique in object oriented programming where multiple method arecalled on the \n",
    "   same object in s single line\n",
    "   -it works when each method return the object itself (self) allowing the the next method to \n",
    "    be called on it immediately\n",
    "\n",
    "Q25 what is the purpose of __call__method in python\n",
    "-> make object callable turn instances into function like object\n",
    " - encapsulation behavior store data in the object and define behavior when the object is called \n",
    " - useful for function wrapper decorators and custom callable object\n",
